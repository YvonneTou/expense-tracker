# Monthly expenses tracking made with React.js

This is a personal project made using React.js.

It is a monthly expense tracker where user is able to view expenses all at once or filtered by year. When expenses are filtered by year, a bar chart is also shown for the selected year. User can also add new expense using the 'Add new expense' form.
